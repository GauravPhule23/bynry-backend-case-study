## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Bynry Backend Case Study. The goal was to demonstrate backend proficiency by addressing three core challenges:
1.  **Transactional Integrity:** Refactoring flawed Python logic into an atomic Node.js implementation.
2.  **Database Design:** Architecting a schema that supports multi-tenancy, batch tracking, and read-heavy workloads.
3.  **API Implementation:** Building a logic-heavy "Low Stock Alert" system.
